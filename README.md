# Thronesquiz
<br>
This homework was designed for students to create a timed quiz using HTML, CSS and JS. A result of the score is shown at the end displaying how the user did on the quiz. If the timer runs out the score is displayed with how many correct answers the user completed up until time ran out. Scores with initials should also be logged at the end.
